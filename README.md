**AIM:**
To explore various prompting techniques for generating audio using AI models. The goal is to understand how different types of prompts influence the generation of audio — including music, sound effects, and speech — and how to optimize these prompts for specific use cases.

### **AI TOOLS REQUIRED:**

* **For Assistance:** ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek
* **For Audio Generation:** MusicGen, Bark, Riffusion

---

### **Prompt:**

"Generate a piece of ambient background music suitable for a focus/study session. The audio should be calm, loopable, and approximately 30 seconds in length. Avoid sudden changes in tone, and ensure it maintains a consistent rhythm."

**(Additional Examples):**

* “Create a realistic forest soundscape with occasional bird chirps and a gentle stream.”
* “Generate a motivational voiceover that encourages daily productivity, in a calm female voice.”
* “Produce a 10-second sci-fi sound effect for a spaceship docking sequence.”

### **Procedure:**

1. **Define Application Needs:** Identify personal or user-centric audio requirements (e.g., study music, reminders, sound effects for content creation).
2. **Design Prompts:** Construct clear and descriptive prompts for various audio generation tasks.
3. **Model Selection:** Choose the appropriate AI audio generation model (e.g., MusicGen for music, Bark for speech).
4. **Prompt Execution:** Run prompts through selected models and analyze the outputs.
5. **Iterate:** Refine prompts based on the audio quality and user feedback.
